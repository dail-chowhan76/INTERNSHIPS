Housing Price Prediction – Task 3
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the California Housing dataset. The objective is to build a machine learning regression model that estimates median house value based on different housing features.

This is a regression problem because the output is a continuous numerical value.

🎯 Objective
To develop a model that predicts housing prices using features such as income, house age, number of rooms, population, and location.
